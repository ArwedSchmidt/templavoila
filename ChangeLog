 + Added versioning sidebar item directly to the default sidebar instead of letting the version extension providing it.

2004-09-08  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

 ~ Made everything DBAL compliant.
 + Added core version dependency to emconf.php (3.7.0.dev)
 * mod1: Added a dynamic sidebar and moved all meta information (like language selector, header fields etc.) into sidebar items.
 ~ mod1: (Sidebar) Modified the language selector: Now is a selectorbox instead of single links.
 - mod1: Removed version selector. This will now be provided by the versioning extension itself by adding a new sidebar item.
 ~ mod1: Restructuring and cleanup of the whole module. Commented Kasper's new features. Externalized some methods into own classes, namely wizards and sidebar.
 # mod1: Fixed the "show hidden" checkbox which worked just the other way around.
 + Manual: Added a reminder to write a section about sidebar programming
 ~ Updated ToDo
 ~ Changed my email address ;-)

 * Merged Kaspers and my changes.
 * cm2 Added a click menu item for showing on which pages the current content element is used in the pagetree. Bug: If other extensions add click menuitems to second level menus, they will appear here as well (needs core change, is on the ToDo)
 * mod3: Added a TemplaVoila tools module. Later on this should also contain wizard like converting from old-school to templavoila websites.
 * mod3: Added wizard for (re-) building indexing information about element reference (where which content element is used). You'll need to update table definitions in the extension manager.
 * ToDo for element references: Deleting CEs from elsewhere than the page module will not be registered automatically (see ToDo file)

 * Page module: Added "Show hidden elements" box - can be moved to better position in page module
 * Corrected bugs for flagicons if they were not configured (they didn't display correctly of course).
 * Added fallback modes for "pi1" output. Updated manual with new rendering option for fall back modes.
 * Page module: Added "&L=xx" parameter to view-page icon (magnifying glass) so preview link to localized pages is correct.
 * Page module: Added overview of localized versions of other records. This is used when TypoScript is configured with "config.sys_language_overlay". Configurable.

 * Changed the versioning selector...

2004-08-21  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Finally added the "TemplaVoila" module to the Web main module and put some content into it! Now you can manage all your Data Structures and Template Objects from that module including creating new mappings and validate old ones.
 * Also added TAB menus to the TV page module
 * NOTICE: ALL changes here requires most recent 3.7.0-dev version from CVS in order to work!

	* Display and processing (copy, paste, insert etc.) for multi lang support now seems to be stable in the page module.

2004-07-18  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* DS and TO records may now be sorted manually (in the backend). Make sure you update your .sql table definitions (in the extension manager).

2004-07-15  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Committed changes and development from the Paris sessions.
	* @Kasper: There only seemed to be one conflict in mod1/index.php which I could solve easily
	* @All the others: Be careful with this version, I didn't check if everything works. Wait until the next commit

2004-06-17  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Bugfix: headerfields, titlebarcolor etc. didn't work with inherited datastructures. Now they do.
	* New hook in pi1: renderElement_preProcessRow
	* Prepared some things about multi language support. Don't use it yet!
	* Guess what: Updated manual

2004-06-07  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Finished the Create New Page Wizard to an acceptable state ;-)
	* Created new Page TSconfig: createPageWizard.fieldNames
	* Other cool stuff. But I don't remember exactly ...
	* Updated manual (as usual)

2004-06-04  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added new tag for data structures: <titleBarColor> (configures page module)
	* Updated manual

2004-06-03  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Re-implemented userfunctions in cm1 (eTypes, extra fields) to comply with the recommended way of providing hooks. I guess no other extension than mine has used that so far ...
	* Added hook in page module for inserting HTML code at the very top of the edit page screen - for providing a toolbar or sth. similar
	* Updated manual

2004-03-31  Kasper Skårhøj,,,  <kasper@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug in htmlmarkup class where content were merged with template; When the number of "virtual records" exceeded a limit, none were merged.

2004-03-26  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added icons, sponsored by Ben
	* Modified TSconfig userFunction properties for cm1 and updated manual

2004-03-24  Kasper Skårhøj
	* Added a syntax highlight module for FlexForm data in tt_content and pages; access it as admin via the click menu of pages / tt_content elements.

2004-03-22  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added two new TSconfig properties: mod.xMOD_tx_templavoila_cm1.eTypesExtraFormFieldsUserfunctions and mod.xMOD_tx_templavoila_cm1.eTypesConfGenUserfunctions

See the updated many for more information. BTW: Thanks for the extra fields!

2004-03-15  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Hey Kasper, you broke the create new page wizard ... ;-) Anyways, will find out what's wrong.
	* Small update for the manual (FAQ)

2004-03-09  Kasper Skårhøj

	* Removed copy,cut,paste,new,delete links in Context Menu for content elements inside of TemplaVoila module; Doesn't do any good there since those features are specific for TemplaVoila and has to be managed in the module itself; Alternatively we should create menu items in the context menu which does the same as the buttons in the module, but that was too hard for me to think about tonight....
	* Added support for other root elements in backend module than pages. Setting another root element is done by the parameter set "&altRoot[table], &altRoot[uid], &altRoot[flex_field]"
	* Added clickmenu item for "TV children" in "content elements" -> a link to direct management of that element and subelements. Using the feature described above.
	* Fixed a few things with mapping, for instance that TypoScript Object Path can now be set in a little field - very convenient...

2003-12-22  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

2003-12-18  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Just an upload ...
	* Added new configuration for the EM: now you may specify the PID of the template folder (better idea than hardcode it to uid #2 ;-)
	* Browsetree gets updated, Page module (web_layout) is completely overridden: shortcut, edit page etc.
	* Various other things ...
