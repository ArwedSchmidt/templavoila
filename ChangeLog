	* Bugfix: headerfields, titlebarcolor etc. didn't work with inherited datastructures. Now they do.
	* New hook in pi1: renderElement_preProcessRow
	* Prepared some things about multi language support. Don't use it yet!
	* Guess what: Updated manual

2004-06-07  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Finished the Create New Page Wizard to an acceptable state ;-)
	* Created new Page TSconfig: createPageWizard.fieldNames
	* Other cool stuff. But I don't remember exactly ...
	* Updated manual (as usual)

2004-06-04  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added new tag for data structures: <titleBarColor> (configures page module)
	* Updated manual

2004-06-03  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Re-implemented userfunctions in cm1 (eTypes, extra fields) to comply with the recommended way of providing hooks. I guess no other extension than mine has used that so far ...
	* Added hook in page module for inserting HTML code at the very top of the edit page screen - for providing a toolbar or sth. similar
	* Updated manual

	* Added a syntax highlight module for FlexForm data in tt_content and pages; access it as admin via the click menu of pages / tt_content elements.

2004-03-22  Robert Lemke  <rl@robertlemke.de>

	* Added two new TSconfig properties: mod.xMOD_tx_templavoila_cm1.eTypesExtraFormFieldsUserfunctions and mod.xMOD_tx_templavoila_cm1.eTypesConfGenUserfunctions

See the updated many for more information. BTW: Thanks for the extra fields!

	* Hey Kasper, you broke the create new page wizard ... ;-) Anyways, will find out what's wrong.
	* Small update for the manual (FAQ)

2004-03-09  Kasper Skårhøj

	* Removed copy,cut,paste,new,delete links in Context Menu for content elements inside of TemplaVoila module; Doesn't do any good there since those features are specific for TemplaVoila and has to be managed in the module itself; Alternatively we should create menu items in the context menu which does the same as the buttons in the module, but that was too hard for me to think about tonight....
	* Added support for other root elements in backend module than pages. Setting another root element is done by the parameter set "&altRoot[table], &altRoot[uid], &altRoot[flex_field]"
	* Added clickmenu item for "TV children" in "content elements" -> a link to direct management of that element and subelements. Using the feature described above.
	* Fixed a few things with mapping, for instance that TypoScript Object Path can now be set in a little field - very convenient...
