INBOX (imposed by Robert ...)

	- (Re-) implement support for thead and tbody for HTML markup class.

Localization:
1: SELECT FROM tt_content WHERE language_uid = (fr) and language_original_uid = (uid of the default language record)
2: is <languageDisable> ?
	If not:
	3: Get language specific values for the fields
		- Either per-field
		- Or per-structure
	- Enable multi language functions:
		- FlexForm features are now supported by the page module (processing (copy, paste etc.) and displaying)
		- For non-flexform elements, use future core language support:
			- tt_content elements refering to the default version, but with translation
			- In TCA for tt_content, have a list of fields which are the ones being overlaid (optional if blank/zero fields should be overlaid too)
			- In TCEforms this will also allow us see a simultaneous view of translations.



NOW:
	- Management: Overview of Page Templates as set in the tree structure
		- Look for Flexible Content ELements as well and evaluate if their data structure / template object matches...
	- Management: Well-designed overview of Data Structures and Their Templates and how they relate (parents/children)
		- Backend Module in Web> displaying DS/TOs in a list, linking to display data structures etc. Usage counts? All kinds of nice things...
	- DS selection depending on TO selection
	- ###STORAGE_PID###
	- Support for sheets: both page header + content elements! (KASPER)


Various:
	- BUG: When clicking the path link of a RANGE to preview it, we will see only the first element in the visual frame - because the RANGE part is cut away!
	- BUG: When mapping via File > Filelist old mapping information is restored - this should be bound to the filename of the template file so a FRESH mapping approach does not get old mapping info.
	- Perform a check of template files for block/solo tag consistens.
	- BUG: When remapping a TO it might loose the settings for the header sections!
	- Check for PHP5 compliance


OTHER MODULES:
- Conversion tool that can take the original tt_content elements from columns are move into relations of Templavoila - in whole brances of the tree!


Related to rendering/content elements (css_styled_content):
 - OK: increase $this->cObj->parentRecordNumber - done by RECORDS cObject!
 - OK: if register[maxImageWidth] is set, this will override maxW - this is fixed by inserting in the data structure LOAD_REGISTER / RESTORE_REGISTER!
 - Remove "Columns" field from tt_content
 - Remove "Divider" content element type.
 - $cObj bug in templavoila, "<stdWrap>" tag
 - Use "Content from page" pid from page headers if there (Rendering: Means, that the other page must be looked up!)


- Mapping features (Kasper, not urgent but annoying for developers...):
	- While editing an existing Data Element it's confusing that the button "Save" has no effect unless you "Add" the changes before. Rename label?
	- "class.tx_templavoila_htmlmarkup.php"
	- Ability to map NEW non-existing attributes AND possibly just any content into HTML tags (like for images ' width="xxx" height="xxx"'.
	- Ability to select attributes to be REMOVED in a tag.
	- Ability to map a single field to MANY elements. So the same value can be inserted at multiple positions.
	- BUG: Assigning an attribute to the FIRST(?) element inside a container will break other elements mapping after that.
		- Other bugs, loosing mapping. Nico had it (actually because of an excess </a> tag, so it was HTML nesting inconsistency!!), I had it on Vignette site. Robert had it too ;-)
		- Also Vignette site exploded itself.
	- For dynamic creation of Data Structure: Have an intelligent auto-mapper, trying to find which elements might most likely be mapped and which not.
	- Support inclusion of the EXTERNAL files in the TO serialized array (new field?) so that TOs could be exported WITH all images, stylesheets, JavaScripts... (portable!)
	- When mapping to eg. a Outer table which has an id, then the sub elements will lock them selves to the id as well, which means when we change the mapping for the outer table we will loose the inner mapping.
	- Allow to re-order the elements in DataStructures when created on-the-fly
	- Anchors in template document
	- Non-destructive explode for <tr> / <option>
	- For predefined images, allow to read and keep the other parameters that src/width/height
	- Option to wipe out the id's used (or those prefixed "TV-") since they could be repetitive.
	- BUG: If you map ONLY the root element then nothing gets saved in the template! - Could NOT reproduce again!
	- BUG: IF there are <a> tag elements in the source which has only "name" attribute then the numbering doesn't work. For instance: <a name=".."> .... <a href="blabla">. The last A-tag is detected as "a[1]" while it should be a[2]. The problem is that when you set mapping mode (INNER /OUTER) for a[1] it will find the REAL a[1] tag, not the one with the href- attribute!
	- BUG: Specifying a range: It only sees the SAME kind of tags even if other tags are found on the same level. An example was: <p>... <font>... <p> ... etc. tags. All <p> tags was found and the range was made from the first to the last. BUT ONLY the <p> tags were substutited - the <font> tags in between stayed after the mapping! That was strange!
	- // ONLY ALLOW "arrays" inside of "sections" - otherwise it does not make so much sense and it is harder to handle; basically all stuff in a SECTION is defined to be a container and that is what the "array" handles...
	- Better define vocabulary! Also define what is a "HTML-path" etc.
	- Find method for displaying images in sample data.
	- Add caching mechanism for retrieval of template content (so we can also have a DYNAMIC binding to the template source, possibly with a timed caching)
	- Support for http-URLs instead of files (incl. caching)
	- Icons for MAP/ChMode/Remap
	- Performance:
		- Caching of splitting template files -> faster process
	- Testing: Implement sites like HP site, Vignette site (to test that it is robust and stable!)
	- Allow "old-style" mapping where a data structure immediately finds subparts/markers in HTML code...
	- Valg af farvecode for sample data... (preset formatting, images, etc?)
	- Re-mapping: Find a way to not overwrite all changes that have been made to the DS's typoscript object paths.
- API Usage:
	- API: A function which can produce a traditionally marked up version of the template: For use in TS as alternative to the Autoparser
	- ?: How can extensions supply a default template Array when no Template Object exists yet, mapping the data? What about the data structure containing some sample markup as well which means we can always assemble a simple display from that. Or even a nice default display which is of course stylable by CSS. AND this default
	- Implement the language scheme?
- "cm" Backend Modules:
	- getLL usage in whole module.
	- CSH for whole module

- Benoit request: "Re-map a HTML node ==> try to re-map the children"
- Benoit request: "Anchor in the HTML page when you are mapping fields... you are scrolling for each field"

Roberts TODO:
***************

INBOX:
- "Web > Page" Backend Modules:
	- New wizard:
		- In Content Element Wizard, also list records to insert as references fetched from the storage page
		- Import t3d files with FlexForm structures inside (requires support for FlexForms in T3D - waiting for Kasper)
		- Offer to make copies of pages/elements found storage page (or otherwise, defined by Page TSconfig, "mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1" ?)
	- User management: In a Data structure define which users and groups has access to edit etc from thsi point and outwards. At any point in the tree these rights can be overridden. This should be fixed by Robert Lemke? :-)
	- "createPageWizard.fieldNames" moved to "mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1" branch of Page Tsconfig!
	- Use "Content from page" pid from page headers if there (Page module: Means, that a notice is shown, just like if the page was a "sysFolder" or the like which cannot contain content)
	- Do not allow content creation on pages like "Shortcut" and "Extenal URL".


GENERAL:
	- Clean up the locallang-files mess in mod1/ !
	- Implement the concept of Data Sources for plugin "pi2"
		-> Better create Data Sources as a independent concept (see Datasources thoughts & ToDo)
		- Distinguish "Data Sources" (could be ODBC etc.) and "Content Sources" ?
		- Make Content Sources usable and (pre-)viewable in Page Module
	- Create conditions for DS/TO selection, configurable via Page TSconfig:
		- Depending on rootlevel
		- Depending on branch
	- Implement access rights on CE level (instead on page level), use ACL! -> Core changes by Kasper
	- Do proper interface for commonly used classes / functions
		- rules class API
		- DS / XML functions

ELEMENT REFERENCING:
	- Create hook in t3lib_TCEmain->deleteRecord which allows us to update referencing information whenever a content element or page is deleted
	  from somewhere else than the TV page module!

RULES:
	- Show what rule in a user-friendly way if a rule doesn't apply or for informational purposes.
	- Permissions for users to certain elements areas: Probably User TSconfig is used to define a list of "groups" for data structures.
	- Disable edit for some elements?
	- Rule editor for click menu and page module
	- Finish rule compliance check:
		- braces [sub] (not finished)
		- classes [class] (not started)
	- Add solution commands to the status array: Everytime sth is against the rules, some command will be added which would make the page complying to that rule.


		<Kaspers bitching>
		a = CType={text,textpic},list_type=tx_templavoila_pi1


		b :
			CType = list
			list_type = tx_templavoila_pi1
			txtemplavoila_to = 3
			width = 0-200

		a :
			CType = list
			list_type = tx_templavoila_pi1

		c :
			CType = list
		</Kaspers bitching>

WIZARDS & CLICK MENUS:
	- Create new content wizard:
		- FEATURE: Implement Flexible Content Elements
		- FEATURE: Quick-Click mode: Shows only the icons of content elements in a layer, like a clickmenu
	- Create new page wizard:
		- FEATURE: Ability to create new element based on t3d file (having dummy content or default nested stuff) -> Wait for Kasper
		- it should be possible to disable the new page wizard at all
	- Select Template CM: (NEW)
		- FEATURE: Instead of having to edit the page header, provide a horizontal clickmenu for selecting DS/TO by clicking the TO icon.
	- TypoScript Tool: (NEW)
		- Makes it easier to edit the TypoScript chunks within DataStructures, accessable from FCE or DS
		- implement as clickmenu?
	- Click menu "Pages using this element ->":
		- Display language flag icon and jump to correct language
		- Hide second level menuitems provided by other extenions (Needs little core change in alt_clickemenu.php!)

PAGE MODULE:
	- If page has no template object selected and no TO is inherited by other page, display message and create dialogue for selecting a template
	- Support for sheets: content elements!
	- Display of CEs
		- Better preview for TABLE element
	- Configure option (in DS): Columns *below* each other instead of side by side display (DASSAULT)
	- Show content in module depending on page type, eg. "sysFolder", "spacer", "Normal / Advanced" etc.
		- For shortcut pages etc, rather show which page it is referring to in Web>Page (TV)
	- After creating a new page, the highlighted <td> in page tree must be set (ids array) - how? through top bar via JS?
	- Localization:
		- There seems to be a bug when pasting a CE into a field with a datastructure having langChildren set to 1
		- Bug: Language selector shows broken images when no flag has been defined in sys_languages
		- Bug: Broken image (rules icon?)

SIDEBAR:
	- Add [delete] option to unused elements menu to REALLY delete elements.

TECHNICAL:
	- Delivery to a) different clients X b) in various languages.
	- Versioning: Part of TCEmain
	- Workflow: Independant.
	- Permissions: Part of TCEmain.
	- Frontend Editing should be available.
		-> Seems to work at first sight but must check what is still missing

DOCUMENTATION:
	- Create manual:
		- Description of Page Module
		- Description of Rules
		- TSconfig reference
		- "If you see a red dot, the structure does not follow the rules (or you are working with the wrong CMS)"
