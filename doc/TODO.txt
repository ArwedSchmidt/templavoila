FINISHING (A week):
"class.tx_templavoila_htmlmarkup.php"
"cm1/index.php"

- Mapping features:
	- Ability to map NEW non-existing attributes AND possibly just any content into HTML tags (like for images ' width="xxx" height="xxx"'.
	- Ability to select attributes to be REMOVED in a tag.
	- Ability to map a single field to MANY elements. So the same value can be inserted at multiple positions.
	- BUG: Assigning an attribute to the FIRST(?) element inside a container will break other elements mapping after that.
		- Other bugs, loosing mapping. Nico had it, I had it on Vignette site.
		- Also Vignette site exploded itself.
	- For dynamic creation of Data Structure: Have an intelligent auto-mapper, trying to find which elements might most likely be mapped and which not.
	- Support inclusion of the EXTERNAL files in the TO serialized array (new field?) so that TOs could be exported WITH all images, stylesheets, JavaScripts... (portable!)
	- When mapping to eg. a Outer table which has an id, then the sub elements will lock them selves to the id as well, which means when we change the mapping for the outer table we will loose the inner mapping.
	- Allow to re-order the elements in DataStructures when created on-the-fly
	- Anchors in template document
	- Non-destructive explode for <tr> / <option>
	- For predefined images, allow to read and keep the other parameters that src/width/height
	- Option to wipe out the id's used (or those prefixed "TV-") since they could be repetitive.
	- Visual formatting of error page
	- BUG: When clicking the path link of a RANGE to preview it, we will see only the first element in the visual frame - because the RANGE part is cut away!
	- BUG: If you map ONLY the root element then nothing gets saved in the template! - Could NOT reproduce again!
	- BUG: When mapping via File > Filelist old mapping information is restored - this hsould be bound to the filename of the template file so a FRESH mapping approach does not get old mapping info.
- Commenting + documentation i SXW fil.
	- Better define vocabulary! Also define what is a "HTML-path" etc.
	- // ONLY ALLOW "arrays" inside of "sections" - otherwise it does not make so much sense and it is harder to handle; basically all stuff in a SECTION is defined to be a container and that is what the "array" handles...
	- REMEMBER: This will be a cornerstone extension, so it must be well tested, documented and commented!
- Performance:
	- Caching of splitting template files -> faster process
- Various, Later:
	- Find method for displaying images in sample data.
	- Perform a check of template files for block/solo tag consistens.
	- Add caching mechanism for retrieval of template content (so we can also have a DYNAMIC binding to the template source, possibly with a timed caching)
	- Support for http-URLs instead of files (incl. caching)
	- API: A function which can produce a traditionally marked up version of the template: For use in TS as alternative to the Autoparser
	- ?: How can extensions supply a default template Array when no Template Object exists yet, mapping the data? What about the data structure containing some sample markup as well which means we can always assemble a simple display from that. Or even a nice default display which is of course stylable by CSS. AND this default
	- Backend Module in Web> displaying DS/TOs in a list, linking to display data structures etc. Usage counts? All kinds of nice things...
	- Show a little warning if no template record was selected in _pi1...
	
	- getLL usage in whole module.
	- CSH for whole module
	- Documentation
	- Icons for MAP/ChMode/Remap

Unsorted notes (kasper)
- Implement the language scheme!
- For shortcut pages etc, rather show which page it is referring to in Web>Page (TV)
- Counting references to objects in some table?
- New wizard:
	- In Content Element Wizard, also list records to insert as references fetched from the storage page
	- Import t3d files with FlexForm structures inside
	- Offer to make copies of pages/elements found storage page (or otherwise)
- BUG: Moving a referenced element MOVES it from the original position!
- Offer a button in Web>Page which can turn a reference into a true copy (for the element alone or all nested records?)
	
	
TESTING:
- Implement sites like HP site, Vignette site (to test that it is robust and stable!)


Roberts TODO:
- Implement the concept of Data Sources for plugin "pi2"
- Implement/maintain the rules scheme
	- When page is created without the create new page wizard, default elements must also be created!
- Implement wizards for creating new page/new content element
	- Remember the current "Create page content wizard"; These icons / setups should somehow be implemented as well.
- Clean up the locallang-files mess in mod1/ !

Interface:
  - Recursivity handling:
	- Prevent recursivity
	- Warn for 1) recursivity, 2) reuse of same element, 3) elements outside of PID, 4) non-used elements, 5) If elements has references on other pages.
  - Rules:
	- number of elements in a field, which types, ...
	- Permissions for users to certain elements areas.
	- Disable edit for some elements?
	- Rule editor for click menu and page module
- Support for sheets: both page header + content elements! (KASPER)
- Hierarchy tree view of the relations (incl. sheets, multiple groupfields in each element)
- Display of CEs
	- Better preview for TABLE element
	- Provide a way for plugins to generate certain previews ?

Interface parts:
- Create new page / content element wizard
	- Ability to create new element based on t3d file (having dummy content or default nested stuff)
- Main interface



Questions:
- How to manage multi-language sites?
  ANSWER:
  	- Use FlexForms build-in possibilities (is already rendered right!) + possibility to exclude certain fields, eg. tt_content group fields
	- For non-flexform elements, use future core language support:
		- tt_content elements refering to the default version, but with translation
		- In TCA for tt_content, have a list of fields which are the ones being overlaid (optional if blank/zero fields should be overlaid too)
		- In TCEforms this will also allow us see a simultaneous view of translations.
- content preview?

Technical:
- Delivery to a) different clients X b) in various languages.
- Versioning: Part of TCEmain
- Language: Part of TCEmain/FlexForms
- Workflow: Independant.
- Permissions: Part of TCEmain.
- Frontend Editing should be available.
	-> Seems to work at first sight but must check what is still missing

NOTES:
- Make sure that a content element is not called recursively
- FE: Disable edit icon for some elements (same in backend?)

OTHER MODULES:
- Management: Overview of Page Templates as set in the tree structure
- Management: Well-designed overview of Data Structures and Their Templates and how they relate (parents/children)
